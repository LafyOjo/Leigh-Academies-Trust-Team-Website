                      The team provides professional guidance to staff across the Trust, covering all aspects of marketing.

                      <strong>Audience targeting</strong> Identifying viable channels of communication that will reach the academy’s target demographic.
                      Audience relationship management - monitoring and assessing the public opinion of an academy and providing guidance to leaders and staff which supports the enhancement of audience attitudes and opinions.
                      Digital marketing - from running engaging, tailored, targeted advertising campaigns through a range of social media platforms, to advising senior leaders and their teams as to how to improve their rankings in search results. <br><br>
                      
                      <strong> Traditional marketing </strong> Although LAT adopts a ‘digital first’ approach where possible, when it comes to raising general awareness often the traditional methods are best. Marketing services are able to advise academies regarding the options and associated costs where traditional is deemed appropriate.
                      A key function of the Marketing Services team involves reviewing the results of campaigns and using that information to inform future marketing activity. In doing so, the team is able to improve an academy’s return on advertising spend, ensuring that even smaller budgets get great results.

                    We provide a professional and branded approach to projects across all our academies and the Trust as a whole. Whether it’s creating a brand new logo for a future academy or developing the brand for an existing one, it’s necessary to portray each academy in the best possible light to potential clients or parents looking to choose a school for their child. Good branding gives an academy the edge among its competitors in a professional capacity.

                    A main school prospectus, adverts/social media to promote open days and events, or a complete rebrand are among the many projects Design Services can help with and develop for an academy. Working closely with Principals’ and academy staff, Design Services will advise and encourage them to use LAT Creative when promoting their academy across a range of different mediums and channels, the design of which can be tailored to suit a range of audiences.

                    In addition to supporting LAT’s academies, Design Services also works with other departments within the Trust including the Engagement and Recruitment teams, enabling them to build their own brand whilst still maintaining that of the Trust.

                    Design Services work closely with their Marketing and Web colleagues within LAT Creative.

                 The team works closely with academies and central departments to provide training, advice and support for websites and other online platforms. 

                 The design, build and functionality are driven by UI/UX trends but mainly our users to achieve this we continually monitor user feedback and analytic data to ensure our users are getting a great experience.
